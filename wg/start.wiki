====== Working Groups ======

There is no formal structure for IATI Working Groups right now, however, a number of ad-hoc working groups are emerging, and so there is space here for those groups to develop working notes and documents. 

===== Current ad-hoc groups =====

[[wg:api:start|API Standardisation]] - working to develop an API contract for aggregators of IATI data

[[wg:geo:start|Location / Geocoding standards]] - discussing developments in the Geocoding methodology for IATI

[[wg:toolkit:start|Aid Information Toolkit]] - exploring ideas for a toolkit of scripts and resources for working with IATI data.
