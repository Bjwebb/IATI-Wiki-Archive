====== Aid Information Toolkit ======
{{:tools:toolkit:openaidtoolkit.png?200 |}}
Linked to work on the idea of a [[roadmap:create_iati_public_good_architecture_blueprints|Public Good Infrastructure]] we have been exploring the idea of creating a distribution of open source tools that all work together to perform key data access and use functions.

A full outline of the 'Open Aid Information Toolkit' idea [[https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1hsBLPzBxL3FQ7WdRutLlE19iw7pY_7k14e1I_p9zm3E|can be found in this document]].

This page can be used to start scoping out that work.

===== Desirable features / Architecture =====

//What features would be desirable in a set of tools.//

A powerful and interoperable set of scripts

  * Able to run across platforms
  * Shared configuration (e.g. for working directories etc.)
  * Able to be connected together as a pipeline of tools

Developer friendly
  * Command line tools;
  * Open source;

User friendly
  * Accessible web-based front end
  * Cloud version available
  * Easy to install and deploy

Managing provenance
  * Should make it possible to understand what has happened to data along a processing pipeline

====== Tools required ======

==== Registry download tool ====

For fetching any changed packages for a given query. 

[[sync_tools|Sync Tools Development Notes]]

== Related tools ==

  * [[http://packages.python.org/datapkg/|DataPkg]] is a command line tool for uploading or downloading data from CKAN
  * [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ckanclient|CKAN Client]] is a Python library for working with CKAN
  * [[https://github.com/okfn/iatitools/blob/master/1-iatidownload.py|OKFN IATI Tools]] includes scripts for downloading IATI data

==== Validation tool ====

For validating IATI XML files.

Should be able to:
  * Check for well formed data
  * Validate against the schema
  * Check for codelist values

==== Provenance module ====


====== Design patterns ======

  * We need environment variables that can be shared across scripts
  * We need a shared logging framework

Consider a model with a **master script** and then a set of **plugins**. Scripts would be executed from the master script to allow use of the same logging framework etc. 

[[Script interface]]

Look at
  * [[http://eventlet.net/doc/design_patterns.html|Eventlet]] to support parallel processing
  * Python [[http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html|Logging]] module.

====== Distribution Management =====

We need a light-weight structure to manage a community of contributors. Consider [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=567793.567795|learning from the Open Source community]]. 

====== Links, source code and development plans ======
