====== Script interface ======

//Notes on how scripts as part of the [[tools:toolkit:start]] should interface.//

Design goals:
  * Possible to include modules in other code
  * Possible to call scripts on the command line to batch process a set of files
    * Make easy to run in parallel or in map-reduce type arrangements
  * Possible to wrap scripts in a REST web service

Scripts should accept input:

  * Piped to stdin
  * From a filename or URL passed to the script as a command line parameter
  * From a file listing files passed to the script as a command line parameter
  * Iteratively through a set of directories

Scripts should offer output:

  * To stdout
    * As IATI XML (where appropriate)
    * As plaintext (where appropriate)
    * As templated HTML (where appropriate)
  * To an output file passed to the script as a command line parameter
  * To a directory structure as determined by default values or command line parameters
