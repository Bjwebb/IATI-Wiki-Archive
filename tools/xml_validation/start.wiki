===== XML Validation =====

==== xmllint ====
[[http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html|xmllint]] is a command line tool that can be used to check xml files for validation against the IATI Standard xml schemas.

=== Examples ===
Test an xml file against a schema  
  
  xmllint --noout --schema  http://iatistandard.org/downloads/iati-activities-schema.xsd some_data_file.xml
  xmllint --noout --schema  http://iatistandard.org/downloads/iati-organisations-schema.xsd some_data_file.xml
  
To send the errors to a file

  xmllint --noout --schema  http://iatistandard.org/downloads/iati-activities-schema.xsd some_data_file.xml 2> errors.txt
  
To make an XML file more readable in your text editor:

  xmllint --format --recover input_file.xml > output_file.xml
 

==== IATI Public Validator ====
/* Please provide a brief description of the tool, and upload a screenshot if possible. Include details of the tool creator. */
This is a PHP application that can be run on a web-server to run checks over single files or pasted code. \\
Files can be uploaded or pulled from a URL \\
The application parses XML files into memory before running routines so can be quite memory intensive.\\
