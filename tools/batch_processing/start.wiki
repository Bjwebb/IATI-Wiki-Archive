===== Batch Processing =====
==== IATI-Data-Spotter ====
/* Please provide a brief description of the tool, and upload a screenshot if possible. Include details of the tool creator. */
This is a PHP application that can be run on a web-server to run checks over batches of data. \\
Currently the source code is available, but there is not a public interface.\\
The application parses XML files into memory before running routines so can be quite memory intensive.\\

There is discussion about whether or not a public interface should be added to the tool to enable people to upload their own files and check them themselves, or whether this should just be a public interface onto all the data in the [[http://iatiregistry.org|registry]], or both.
