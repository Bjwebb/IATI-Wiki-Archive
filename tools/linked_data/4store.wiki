This guide is based on starting with a blank Ubuntu 10 LTS [[http://www.turnkeylinux.org/core|Turnkey Core server image]]. This can be run in a Virtual machine or cloud hosting. The instructions may work for other Ubuntu systems, but will need adapting for different flavours of linux.

==== Setup Store ====

Setup a backend database for IATI data

  4s-backend-setup iati

Launch the backend

  4s-backend iati
  
Set up a HTTP server for it:

  4s-httpd iati -p 80
  # Using port 80 for now. We should switch to something else later and proxy through Apache for security. 

(If on the TurnkeyHub, you might need to update the firewall rules to allow port 80 through).
