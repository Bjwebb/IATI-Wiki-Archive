====== Research for Development Widgets ======
/* Please provide a brief description of the tool, and upload a screenshot if possible. Include details of the tool creator. */

The Research for Development-IATI widget makes use of linked data from IATI and Research for Development to provide a widget that displays research relating to a particular DFID project. 

Access a [[http://r4d.herokuapp.com/|demonstration install here]].

===== Detailed Description =====
/* Provide additional details here */

Data from IATI and Research for Development is periodically converted into RDF Linked Data and [[kasabi.com/dataset/r4d-aid-data|loaded into a triple store on the Kasabi platform]]. A node.js and javascript application ([[https://github.com/marxian/r4d|source]]) [[http://r4d.herokuapp.com/|deployed to Heroku]] can take any DFID Aries code (found in IATI identifiers as xxxx in GB-1-xxxxxx) and check for related research publications which are then presented in a configurable widget.

The widget can display research with or without a border, to allow easier embedding into third party websites.

==== Front end ====

The demonstration application at [[http://r4d.herokuapp.com/]] provides sample javascript code for embedding the widget. It currently only accepts DFID Aries codes.

Only some ARIES codes have attached research projects. When research is not found linked to an identifier the widget will not display. 

Note that some IATI identifiers are for components of DFID projects (e.g. 100234-101) rather than the overall project (100234) to which research records are linked. If you have one of these identifiers, you may wish to strip off the end component. 

==== Back end ====

The data is stored on Kasabi in [[http://kasabi.com/dataset/r4d-aid-data|a triple store which can be accessed via SPARQL]].

The data is currently loaded to this triple store using a set of Python scripts. 

=== To install and run the scripts ===

Either [[https://github.com/practicalparticipation/International-Development-Linked-Data-Tools-|see the instructions here]] or a pre-configured server is available via the Turnkey Linux Backup Management service. Contact [[community:user:TimDavies|Tim Davies]] for access.
