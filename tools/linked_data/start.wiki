====== Linked Data Conversion ======
/* Please provide a brief description of the tool, and upload a screenshot if possible. Include details of the tool creator. */

An initial workflow for converting IATI data into Linked Data, and uploading this to a triple store, has been developed in prototype. 

A copy of the data is currently available through a SPARQL endpoint at http://iati-ld.tklapp.com/sparql/

<note warning>
This [[http://iati-ld.tklapp.com/sparql/|triple store]] is not updated on a scheduled or regular basis. It is possible this data may be behind or out of of synchronisation with current IATI data. Please contact [[community:user:timdavies|Tim Davies]] to request the data is refreshed if you have an application that requires this. 
</note>

<note important>
The current linked data model is draft, and is likely to change.  Please add a note to this page with details of any tools using the linked data so that we can inform users in advance of proposed changes.

===== Detailed Description =====
/* Provide additional details here */

Linked data can support the integration of diverse data sources and extra contextual information linked to IATI project information, as well as providing a flexible way to query IATI data via SPARQL. 

As an XML standard, IATI does not yet have an agreed linked data vocabulary, but a [[http://www.aidinfolabs.org/archives/582|proof of concept has been established]], and a proposal has been made for [[http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/21180347-linked-data|updates to the standard to better accomodate linked data]].
===== Uses =====

The [[http://r4d.herokuapp.com/|Research for Development]] prototype makes use of IATI linked data and research data to present a widget that queries that data via SPARQL to find research related to a given IATI ID. 

The [[http://rhoksoton.github.com/CharityViz/|CharityViz]] widget demo provides a contextual information widget using data accessed with SPARQL. 
===== Documentation =====
/* Provide links to documentation, or use the wiki to develop documentation of this tool. */

Experimental documentation of using [[4Store]] to host IATI linked data is [[4store|here]]. 

Details of the original proof of concept [[http://www.aidinfolabs.org/archives/582|are on AidInfoLabs]].
