====== OIPA V2 ======

OIPA V2 stands for **O**penaid **I**ATI **P**arser and **A**PI. It has been developed within the [[tools:open_aid:start | OpenAid NL]] project and runs as an open webservice. Anyone can use it with the data residing in the OIPA network.

===== Detailed Description =====

OIPA enables IATI standard compliant datasets to easily parse and interface IATI compliant data. OIPA runs as a webservice, which is being reffered to as the OIPA network. OIPA consists of several software components which are dependent on each other.

  * Parser makes the IATI compliant available xml datasets available in the non xml database MySQL. Runs from a Django admin interface where users can call any valid IATI xml URI and ingest it into OIPA.
  * The datamodel now maps +95% of all IATI namespaces and each namespace is mapped into a seperate MySQL table.
  * The API enables web-platforms to easily interface using REST calls to pick up data either using JSON or XML as output.

At present the OIPA network holds data from all the avaialable IATI sets published at the IATI registry. (as of 3/7/12 still ingesting...)

===== Documentation & examples =====

Check the [[http://oipa.openaidsearch.org/api/v2/docs/|OIPA V2 documentation]] and create some REST calls yourself. 

REST calls examples OIPA network:

  * http://search-api-data.openaid.nl/api/data/activity/ | Shows alls activities by Dutch ministry of Foreign affairs
  * http://search-api-data.openaid.nl/api/data/activity/88/ | Shows specific id of an activity
  * http://search-api-data.openaid.nl/api/data/activity/?recipient_country_code=ZW&total_budget__gte=2000000 |Shows activities in a specific country (ZW) with a budget over €2.000.000
  * http://search-api-data.openaid.nl/api/data/activity/?description__contains=human%20rights | Shows all activities where the description contains “human rights”
  * http://search-api-data.openaid.nl/api/data/activity/?sector=Public%20finance%20management |Shows all activities in the sector “Public finance management”
  * http://search-api-data.openaid.nl/api/data/transaction/?activity_id=2 | Shows all transactions within a activity (id=2)
  * http://search-api-data.openaid.nl/api/data/transaction/?activity_id=2&transaction_date__gte=2010-12-31 | Shows all transactions within a activity (id=2) and later than 2010-12-31

After decoding the JSON into variables, the data can be used in a HTML page (eg create table). Nearly every language has a JSON decoding library. Here are some examples:

  * PHP: http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php
  * Python: http://docs.python.org/library/json.html
  * JAVA: http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/
