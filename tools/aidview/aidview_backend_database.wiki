====== AidView Backend Database ======
/* Please provide a brief description of the tool, and upload a screenshot if possible. Include details of the tool creator. */

AidView is powered by an eXist XML database and set of scripts written by [[https://twitter.com/kitwallace|Chris Wallace]]. These are working notes on the process of trying to set up a copy of the database. The backend powers the [[API]] and [[Start|AidView application]].

==== Set up server with eXist ====

Starting with a [[http://www.turnkeylinux.org/core|Turnkey Linux Core image]]. (Mine = root / existpass)

Install open-jdk
 
  apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
  apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk

Fetch latest stable version of eXist from http://exist-db.org/exist/download.xml and follow the [[http://exist-db.org/exist/quickstart.xml#installation|installation instructions]]. Then run the command line installation (your version number may vary...)

  java -jar eXist-setup-1.4.2-rev16251.jar -p /root/eXist


==== Running eXist ====
Check that eXist is installed and will run by changing to the eXist bin directory and running startup.sh

  cd /root/eXist/bin
  ./startup.sh

By default this launches a server bound to localhost, so to access I tunnel to the server

  ssh -f root@[servername] -L 8080:localhost:8080 -N
  
I can how access eXist at http://localhost:8080

Log-in to the admin interface at http://localhost:8080/exist/admin/ to set a password (user management).

To access the server via [[http://demo.exist-db.org:8098/exist/webdav.xml#macosx|WebDav]] on Mac Finder, use Go -> Connect to Server and connect to ''http://localhost:8080/exist/webdav/db'' with the username admin, and password you just set.


==== Install the applications ====

Connected via WebDav, copy the source to /db/

Then visit: http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/apps/iati/xquery/data.xq to access the public homepage.

<note warning>At this point I get stuck...</note>

  * We made need alternative set-up. Something to try later...
==== Import data ====
