====== AidView ======
/* Please provide a brief description of the tool, and upload a screenshot if possible. Include details of the tool creator. */

[[http://www.aidview.net|AidView]] is an tablet optimised interface for exploring IATI data. An alpha version was produced by White October for [[community:aidinfo|AidInfo]] ahead of the [[http://www.aideffectiveness.org/busanhlf4/| Busan Forum on Aid Effectiveness]] and development of the beta is currently underway managed by [[community:user:siwhitehouse|Simon Whitehouse]].

===== Detailed Description =====
/* Provide additional details here */

==== Interface ====

The AidView interface can be accessed at [[http://www.aidview.net]]. It is based around simple faceted browsing where you can:
  * Filter by Country of project; Sector of project; and Donor; and keyword search
  * View 'data file' profiles (when filtered to < 300 projects)
  * View individual project profiles - with a selection of 'widgets' displaying data on the project
  * Collect widgets together


==== API ====
AidView uses an API which stores a sub-set of the data from the IATI Registry and is currently accessible at http://datadev.aidinfolabs.org/xquery/woapi.xq

The data in the API has been through an import pipeline which:
  * Normalises currency to USD
  * Creates total project values based on the highest of total commitments, total disbursement or total spending
  * Pre-computers OLAP cubes for a number of values to support faster queries

Data stored in the API is manually refreshed, and editorialised, so the main corpus of data only includes data appropriate for display in the AidView interface (e.g. recent projects).
 
An open source version of the code for the AidView API is due soon. 

<note warning>
Note: API location is subject to change. Please contact [[community:user:timdavies|Tim Davies]] if you are using the API to be notified of changes.
