===== What is OpenAid NL? =====
In September 2011 the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs started publishing data on all the development aid projects it finances. The data is published in the international IATI standard which is easy for computers to read, but very hard for humans. On openaid.nl the information is made accessible using a web-interface. The web-interface is powered by [[tools:oipa:start|OIPA]], a webservice that runs from the [[tools:oipa:start|OIPA]] network.


===== History =====
Openaid.nl was initiated by [[http://www.akvo.org|Akvo.org]], a Dutch non-profit organisation dedicated to developing internet and mobile tools that make aid more efficient and transparent.
