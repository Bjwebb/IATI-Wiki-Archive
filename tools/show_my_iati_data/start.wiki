/* Please provide a brief description of the tool, and upload a screenshot if possible. Include details of the tool creator. */
A small script to try to make IATI XML a bit more human readable.\\
Currently employed as the 'preview tool', linked when people click 'Preview' on the registry\\
Creator: [[community:user:caprenter]]

===== Detailed Description =====
/* Provide additional details here */
A simple PHP tool that you can throw up on a server. You can submit a URL to the application. If it has IATI data at the end of it, it is parsed and a data tree is produced that can be navigated (requires javascript)\\
See it in action: http://tools.aidinfolabs.org/showmydata/ \\
Example: http://tools.aidinfolabs.org/showmydata/index.php?url=http://projects.dfid.gov.uk/iati/Region/289

It is limited in that it loads files into memory to parse and manipulate them. Very large XML files cause it problems.
