OIPA stands for **O**penaid **I**ATI **P**arser and **A**PI. It has been developed within the [[tools:open_aid:start | OpenAid NL]] project and runs as an open webservice. Anyone can use it with the data residing in the OIPA network.

===== Detailed Description =====

OIPA enables IATI standard compliant datasets to easily parse and interface IATI compliant data. OIPA runs as a webservice, which is being reffered to as the OIPA network. OIPA consists of several software components which are dependent on each other.

  * Parser makes the IATI compliant available xml datasets available in the non xml database MySQL.
  * The datamodel residing in MySQL contains different IATI sets that have been mapped in the parser.
  * The API enables web-platforms to easily interface using REST calls to pick up data.

At present the OIPA network holds data from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

===== Documentation & examples =====

Check the [[http://search-api-data.openaid.nl/api/documentation/|OIPA documentation]] and create some REST yourself. 

REST calls examples OIPA network:

  * http://search-api-data.openaid.nl/api/data/activity/ | Shows alls activities by Dutch ministry of Foreign affairs
  * http://search-api-data.openaid.nl/api/data/activity/88/ | Shows specific id of an activity
  * http://search-api-data.openaid.nl/api/data/activity/?recipient_country_code=ZW&total_budget__gte=2000000 |Shows activities in a specific country (ZW) with a budget over €2.000.000
  * http://search-api-data.openaid.nl/api/data/activity/?description__contains=human%20rights | Shows all activities where the description contains “human rights”

After decoding the JSON into variables, the data can be used in a HTML page (eg create table). Nearly every language has a JSON decoding library. Here are some examples:

  * PHP: http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php
  * Python: http://docs.python.org/library/json.html
  * JAVA: http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/
