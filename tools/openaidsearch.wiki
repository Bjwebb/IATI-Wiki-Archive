====== Global openaidsearch ======

===== Links, source code and development plans =====

Current beta runs [[http://beta.openaidsearch.org/explore/?query&countries=BR|here]]. The beta will be deployed as a production version Q4 2012. Users will be able to filter on more specific IATI namespaces, export to cvs, pdf and will be able to save their queries.

Openaidsearch.org is an interface built on top of [[tools:oipa_v2:start|OIPA-V2]].
