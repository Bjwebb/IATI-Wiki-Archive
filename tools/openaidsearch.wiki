====== Global openaidsearch ======

[[http://www.openaidsearch.org/explore/?query&countries=BR|Openaidsearch.org]] aims to interface all the IATI compliant dataset residing at the IATI registry. It provides users with an interface enabling them to search on that combined dataset using manual queries and filters.


===== Links, source code and development plans =====

The platform runs [[http://www.openaidsearch.org/here]]. Users are able to filter on more specific IATI namespaces, export to cvs, pdf and will be able to save their queries.

Openaidsearch.org is an interface built on top of [[tools:oipa_v2:start|OIPA-V2]].
