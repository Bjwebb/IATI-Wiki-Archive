===== Questions =====

Is there an easy way to find out which datasets are currently handled in the OIPA network, or when the data was last updated?

Not yet. We are devicing a workflow where each and every imported IATI set has its own unique id in the OIPA network. The current setup on the parser side is very manual: download, grab, ingest and done. This process must be automated. We are thinking in the lines of auto-pick URI for each IATI id in the OIPA network, API key for each unique id etc. This is somewhere in the middle of our requirements list ;-)

Once the sets all have unique id's, API keys tracing and monitoring them will become more easy to handle.
