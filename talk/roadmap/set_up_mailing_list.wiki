====== Mailing list ======
Umm, not quite complete. We have a list of TAG 2012 attendees and they have been informed of the mailing list and wiki. But there's loads of other people we need to inform:
  * Those invited to TAG 2012 who didn't come
  * Those who have posted to support.iatistandard.org
  * Open Development mailing list
  * Other groups (UKAN, Bond, BetterAid, etc)

I think we need to build and curate a single list. (Or a super-set list of lists)
