====== Create IATI public good architecture blueprints ======

The IATI public good infrastructure may involve:

  * Tools to aggregate and process IATI data
  * A data store
  * APIs onto that data
  * Convenience services for working with the data
  * Basic visualisation services
  * E-mail alerts

These are all services which it makes sense to either 
  * (a) provide once centrally; 
  * (b) which have the properties of being diminishable public goods; 
  * (c) provide as interchangeable layers of an infrastructure;

As a number of different projects develop that work with IATI data, articulating a shared blueprint for how tools should work together will be beneficial.
