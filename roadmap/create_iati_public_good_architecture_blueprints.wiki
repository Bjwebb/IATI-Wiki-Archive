====== Create IATI public good architecture blueprints ======

The IATI public good infrastructure may involve:

  * Tools to aggregate and process IATI data
  * A data store
  * APIs onto that data
  * Convenience services for working with the data
  * Basic visualisation services
  * E-mail alerts

These are all services which it makes sense to either 
  * a] provide once centrally; 
  * b] which have the properties of being diminishable public goods; 
  * c] provide as interchangeable layers of an infrastructure;

As a number of different projects develop that work with IATI data, articulating a shared blueprint for how tools should work together will be beneficial. 

===== What might be in an IATI Toolkit =====

From [[http://lopad.org/4vf3Bjwnho]].

  * API - data as a service (e.g. Chris' Exist work)
    * Project access
    * Spending access
    * Geographical search
    * Aggregated data
  * database and API 'in a box'
  * data harvesting (from the registry)
  * conversion tools - serialisation
  * currency conversion tool
  * data cleaning tools & routines
  * notification functions
  * code list verficiation
  * mashing datasets
  * documentation for end-users
  * Geographic Information Systems based tools
