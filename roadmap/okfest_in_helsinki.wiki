====== OKFest - IATI Technical Fringe Event ======

OKFest 2012 (http://okfestival.org/) will have an Open Development track, as well as bringing together many more from across the Open Knowledge community. 

At the IATI TAG Meeting in May we discussed holding a IATI Technical Workshop alongside OKFest, to focus on tasks from the shared Technical Roadmap http://wiki.iatistandard.org/roadmap/start and other key issues. 

This has now been arranged for the Thursday of OKFest as a 2 hour slot.
