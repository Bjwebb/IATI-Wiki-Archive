===== Set up mailing list =====
Tim will re-purpose the IATI Tools google group:\\
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/iati-technical

Aidinfo staff will notify their mailing list about the group on Monday 21st May 2012

This was completed by [[community:user:bill.anderson]] on 22nd May 2012.


====== A proper mailing list ======
The task of mailing is not quite complete. We have a list of TAG 2012 attendees and they have been informed of the mailing list and wiki. But there's loads of other people we need to inform:
  * Those invited to TAG 2012 who didn't come
  * Those who have posted to support.iatistandard.org
  * Open Development mailing list
  * Other groups (UKAN, Bond, BetterAid, etc)

I think we need to build and curate a single list. (Or a super-set list of lists)

Good idea.//
So who's job does this become? And when should it be done by?
