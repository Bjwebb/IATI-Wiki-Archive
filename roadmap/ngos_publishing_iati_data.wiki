The IATI TAG Secretariat have been working with BOND to support DFID funded NGOs to publish their activities to the IATI Standard, as stipulated by their DFID funding.

By the end of June, current GPAF and CSCF grant-holders will have published implementation schedules and data. 

Many of the organisations will be using [[:www.aidstream.org|AidStream]]to publish.
