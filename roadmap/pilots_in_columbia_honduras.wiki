=====Pilots in Columbia and Honduras=====
Acclar Open Data and the IATI TAG Secretariat are currently scoping pilots with the governments of Colombia and Honduras, to assess the feasibility of automatic exchange of data from IATI into their Aid Management Systems. 

During the scoping visits, that are planned during July 2012, it is hoped that there will also be an assessment of whether it might be possible to share data on South South Cooperation projects between Colombia and Honduras. 

More details will be posted here as the plans are developed. Contact [[community:user:isabelb_devinit.org|Isabel Bucknall]] if you would like more details.
