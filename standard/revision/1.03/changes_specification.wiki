=====Schema Changes=====
==== Add a Schema Version Attribute to the root element ====
http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/21971586-proposal-add-an-schema-version-attribute-to-the-root-element
===Required Change===
This is a change to the [[http://iatistandard.org/downloads/iati-activities-schema.xsd|iati-activities-schema.xsd]]. \\
This is a change to the [[http://iatistandard.org/downloads/iati-organisations-schema.xsd|iati-organisations-schema.xsd]]. \\
This is a change to the [[http://iatistandard.org/downloads/iati-registry-record-schema.xsd|iati-registry-record-schema.xsd]]. \\
This is a change to the [[http://iatistandard.org/downloads/iati-common.xsd|iati-common.xsd]]. \\
It requires:
  - The addition of an attribute @version to the root element of each schema
  - The version shall reflect the version of the standard, not the version of the document. Documents should only change in line with the standard.
A sample diff is shown below:
<code lang=xml>
-  <xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
+  <xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" version="1.03">
</code>
<code lang=xml>
-  <xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:ir="http://iatiregistry.org/ns/record#" targetNamespace="http://iatiregistry.org/ns/record#">
+  <xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:ir="http://iatiregistry.org/ns/record#" targetNamespace="http://iatiregistry.org/ns/record#" version="1.03">
</code>

=== Reason ===

=== Proposed Changelog text ===
Version numbers now included in the document root. 
Versions match the version of the standard, not the document, although documents will only change in line with the standard.
