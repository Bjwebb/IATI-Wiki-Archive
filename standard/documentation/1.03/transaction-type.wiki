==== Notes ====
This provides the code for the transaction type. There are seven of these: C - Commitment, D - Disbursement, E - Expenditure, IF - Incoming funds, IR - Interest Repayment, LR - Loan Repayment, and R - Reimbursement.


==== Example Usage ====

The code should be declared in any usage of this element:

<code xml>
    <transaction-type code="C"/>
</code>

Additionally, a text description of the code can be provided:

<code xml>
    <transaction-type code="C">Commitment</transaction-type>
</code>

Where this text description is in a language that differs from the default, then this should be declared accordingly:

<code xml>
    <transaction-type code="C" xml:lang="en">Commitment</transaction-type>
</code>
