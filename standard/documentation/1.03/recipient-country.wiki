===== Recipient Country ===== 
{{for revison 1.02}}

==== Example Usage ====

Recipient country can be declared just through the relevant code:
<code xml>
<recipient-country code="CG"/>
</code>
Additionally, the name of the country can also be declared.
<code xml>
<recipient-country code="CG">Democratic Republic of Congo</recipient-country>
</code>
Where the name of the country is declared in a language other than the default, it is good practice to cite this:
<code xml>
 <recipient-country code="CG" xml:lang="fr">Republique Democratique du Congo</recipient-country>
</code>
When multiple countries are declared, then the percentages should equal 100% for that activity

<code xml>
<recipient-country code="CG" percentage="60"/>
<recipient-country code="AO" percentage="40"/>
</code>
