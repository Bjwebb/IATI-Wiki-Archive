===== Sector ===== 
{{for revision 1.03}}

==== Example Usage ====
A code for the sector can be declared:

<code xml>
<sector code="13040"/>
</code>

Additionally, a text description for the code can be provided:

<code xml>
<sector code="13040">STD control including HIV/AIDS</sector>
</code>

The vocabulary attribute can be used to declare which code reference list is in use.  If this is omitted, then IATI assumes the DAC vocabulary.
<code xml>
<sector vocabulary="WB" code="BC">Central government administration</sector>
</code>

If the specific vocabulary in use is not on the vocabulary codelist, then the value of RO (Reporting Organisation) can be used:
<code xml>
<sector vocabulary="RO">Education</sector>
</code>
When multiple sectors are in use in the same activity, then the percentage attribute should be used - the total of all percentages within the same activity should total 100.
<code xml>
<sector code="13040" percentage="60">STD control including HIV/AIDS</sector>
<sector code="12220" percentage="40">Basic health care</sector>
</code>

Should a description be used that is different to the default language set for the activity, then this should be declared as follows:

<code xml>
<sector code="13040" xml:lang="en">STD control including HIV/AIDS</sector>
</code>

==== Changelog ====
===1.03===
Where used, the @percentage attribute is now designated as a decimal value and no longer as a positive Integer
