===== Recipient Region ===== 
{{for revision 1.03}}

==== Example Usage ====

Recipient region can be declared just through the relevant code:
<code xml>
<recipient-region code="289"/>
</code>
Additionally, the name of the region can also be declared.
<code xml>
<recipient-region code="289">South of Sahara, regional<recipient-region>
</code>
Where the name of the region is declared in a language other than the default, it is good practice to cite this:
<code xml>
<recipient-region code="289" xml:lang="es">Africa subsahariana</recipient-region>
</code>
When multiple regions are declared, then the percentages should equal 100% for that activity

<code xml>
<recipient-region percentage="60" code="289">South of Sahara, regional</recipient-region>
<recipient-region percentage="40" code="189">North of Sahara, regional</recipient-region>
</code>

Additionally, a [[region vocabulary http://iatistandard.org/codelists/region_vocabulary/]] can also be declared in this element

<code xml>
<recipient-region vocabulary="1" code="289">South of Sahara, regional</recipient-region>
</code>

==== Changelog ====
===1.03===
Where used, the @percentage attribute is now designated as a decimal value and no longer as a positive Integer
