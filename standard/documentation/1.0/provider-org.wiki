===== Provider Org ===== 

===== Receiver Org ===== 
==== Notes ====
The unique organisation identifier for the provider organisation. Some large organisations already have existing codes assigned through the OECD. For those organisations where no code exsits, the organisation can generate their own code for IATI use in the format of country-registration company-registration number. (e.g. the organisation identifier for DIPR is: GB-COH-06368740.)
=== Additional notes ===
Organisation IDs: It is now recommended that organisation ids are built to a convention, so the schema declaration that @ref must be on a codelist is out of date. A change to the schema must occur through our change control process. As such this is flagged for change.

==== Example Usage ====

The full name of the organisation making the financial transaction (receiving in the case of loan and interest repayments).:

<code xml>
    <provider-org>DFID</provider-org>
</code>

The unique Organisation Identifier for the provider.:

<code xml>
    <provider-org ref="GB-1">DFID</provider-org>
</code>

If the funds are being provided from another reported activity, this must record the unique activity identifier for that activity:

<code xml>
    <provider-org provider-activity-id="GB-1-10538"/>
