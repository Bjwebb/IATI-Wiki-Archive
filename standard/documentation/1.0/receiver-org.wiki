==== Notes ====
=== Additional notes ===
Organisation IDs: It is now recommended that organisation ids are built to a convention, so the schema declaration that @ref must be on a codelist is out of date. A change to the schema must occur through our change control process. As such this is flagged for change.
==== Example Usage ====

The full name of the organisation receiving the financial transaction (receiving in the case of loan and interest repayments).:

<code xml>
<transaction>
  ....
    <receiver-org>Ministere du Plan, RDC</receiver-org>
  ...
</transaction>
</code>

The unique Organisation Identifier for the receiver.:

<code xml>
    <receiver-org ref="CG-3">DFID</receiver-org>
</code>

If the funds are being provided to another reported activity, this must record the unique activity identifier for that activity:

<code xml>
    <receiver-org receiver-activity-id="CG-3-1440"/>
</code>
