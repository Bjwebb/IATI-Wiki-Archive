====== Dates and times in XML documents ======

This article describes the syntax of ''dates and times'' in the IATI XML formats.

For dates and times, IATI uses a subset of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601|ISO 8601]] standard.  Dates appear in the format ''YYYY-MM-DD''.  For example, January 1, 2013 will appear as "2013-01-01":

  <value currency="GBP" value-date="2013-01-01">500000</value>
  
In some cases, IATI requires both a date ''and'' a time.  The time appears in the format ''hh:mm:ss'' (with an optional timezone identifier, described below), following the date, separated with the letter "T", so that noon on January 1, 2013 will appear as "2013-01-01T12:00:00":

  <iati-activity version="1.0" last-updated-datetime="2013-01-01T12:00:00">
    ...
  </iati-activity>
  
Since IATI is an international standard, you should normally also include an indication of the timezone in use when you are specifying a time as well as a date.  If you are giving all times in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time|Coordinated Universal Time]] (aka Greenwich Mean Time), then you can simply append the letter 'Z' to the time:

  * 2013-01-01T12:00:00Z -- January 1, 2013, 12:00:00 UTC

In other cases, you specify the offset from UTC by adding a "+" or "-" sign followed by the number of hours and minutes in the format "hh:mm":

  * 2013-01-01T18:00:00+06:00 -- 18:00 in Dhaka, Bangladesh (= 12:00 UTC)
  * 2013-01-01T13:00:00+01:00 -- 13:00 in Paris, France (= 12:00 UTC)
  * 2013-01-01T08:30:00-03:30 -- 08:30 in St John's, Newfoundland (= 12:00 UTC)
  * 2013-01-01T04:00:00-08:00 -- 04:00 in San Francisco, US (= 12:00 UTC)
