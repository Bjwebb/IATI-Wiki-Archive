=====Where Can I...?=====

A newcomer to IATI should find:
  * all basic guidance at iatistandard.org, 
  * Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) in the Knowledge Base (support.iatistandard.org), 
  * answers to specific/individual queries through the ticketing system. 

These interfaces should clearly signpost the existence of the wiki and mailing group.

Over time, guidance material on iatistandard.org will be deployed from the wiki, and changes to the guidance will be done in a clearly demarcated section of the wiki. This makes the guidance on the wiki authoritative.

All discussion documents should be stored in the wiki

All discussion should take place on the mailing group.
