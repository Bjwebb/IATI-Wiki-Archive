=====Where Can I...?=====

A newcomer to IATI should find:
  * All basic guidance at [[http://www.iatistandard.org]], 
  * Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) in the Knowledge Base ([[http://support.iatistandard.org]]), 
  * Answers to specific/individual queries [[http://support.iatistandard.org/anonymous_requests/new|through the ticketing system]]. 

Anyone wishing to be part of the technical community can use the wiki to find:
  * Details of the [[community:mailing_list|Mailing List]]
  * Details of community provided [[tools:Start|tools for working with IATI data]]
  * A shared space for technical note taking and collaboration in the [[roadmap:start|Technical Roadmap section]]

This wiki provides a space for the growing [[community:start|technical community]] to collaborate on documenting elements of the IATI Standard as well as third-party tools, code, how-tos and guidance. 

==== Becoming more consistent ====
We are working towards a more consistent user experience for newcomers to IATI and established members of the technical community alike.

Over time, guidance material on iatistandard.org will be deployed from the wiki, and changes to the guidance will be done in a clearly demarcated section of the wiki. In the future this will make the guidance on the wiki authoritative.

All discussion documents should be stored in the wiki

All discussion should take place on the mailing group.
